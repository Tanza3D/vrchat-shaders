# vrchat-shaders
collection of shaders i've made for various applications in vrchat

### Tanza/Fur
This is a basic fur shader for multicoloured fur. UV 1 is used for the actual fur strand alpha, while UV 2 is used for the colours. The intent of this is to be used with a Fur strand alpha texture and another colour texture.

### Tanza/FurAlternate
Same as above, but this one supports alpha cutout. It's recommended to use this one instead, although the former can look better depending on the situation. Best to try both and see which comes out better.
