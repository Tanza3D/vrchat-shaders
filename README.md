# vrchat-shaders
collection of shaders i've made for various applications in vrchat

### Tanza/Fur
This is a basic fur shader for multicoloured fur. UV 1 is used for the actual fur strand alpha, while UV 2 is used for the colours. The intent of this is to be used with a Fur strand alpha texture and another colour texture.
